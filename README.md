Private Group chat in NodeJS is a real-time messaging application that allows users to communicate with each other in private groups. The application uses Node.js as the backend technology, and Socket.IO for real-time communication between clients and the server.

Some of the main features of this project include:

1. User Authentication: The application requires users to register and log in before they can use the chat system. Users can create a profile, upload a profile picture, and update their personal information.

2. Private Group Chat: Users can create private groups and invite other users to join. Only members of a group can view and participate in group conversations. Users can send text messages, images, and other files to each other in real-time.

3. Notifications: The application sends notifications to users when they receive a new message, or when they are invited to join a group.

4. Group Management: Group administrators can manage group settings, such as adding or removing members, changing the group name or description, and deleting the group.

5. File Sharing: Users can share files with each other within the chat system. The application allows users to upload and download files of various formats such as images, documents, audio, and video files.

Overall, Private Group chat in NodeJS is a modern and highly functional messaging application that provides a secure and reliable platform for private group communication.
